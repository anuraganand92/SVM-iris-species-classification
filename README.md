# Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine(SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. The objective of SVM algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features.

In this project, SVM is used on Iris dataset using different types of kernels and comparison of test accuracy of the kernels. Also Radial Basis Function is used with different gammas along with their visual comparative analysis.
